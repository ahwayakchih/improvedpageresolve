# Improved Page Resolve

- Version: 1.1
- Author: Marcin Konicki (http://ahwayakchih.neoni.net)
- Build Date: 9 April 2009
- Requirements: Symphony version 2.2 or later.

## Overview

Improved Page Resolve allows you to create index page with parameters and show it without a need to include its path in URL.
For example:

http://www.example.com/param_1_value/param_2_value

will work the same way as:

http://www.example.com/url_handle_of_index_page/param_1_value/param_2_value

Unless there is a page with path that is the same as param_1_value, in which case that page will be shown.

## Installation

1. Upload the 'improvedpageresolve' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.
2. Enable it by selecting the "Improved Page Resolve", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

## Changelog

- **1.1** Update for Symphony 2.2.
- **1.0** Initial release.
